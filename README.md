Explanation of Code:

    Data Preparation:
        manufacturing_data: Represents the data of food manufacturing, including production times, raw materials used, and units produced.
        The data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame to allow easy manipulation and analysis.

    Real-Time Data Capture:
        The function capture_real_time_data() simulates capturing data from IoT sensors such as temperature, humidity, machine status, and output rate in the manufacturing plant.

    AI Quality Control:
        The ai_quality_control() function simulates AI-driven analysis to assess product quality based on real-time sensor data.
        AI can evaluate factors such as temperature, output rate, and other variables to classify product quality (e.g., "High Quality", "Low Quality").

    ERP & Low-Code/No-Code Solutions:
        The function recommend_erp_and_no_code_solutions() suggests appropriate ERP systems and no-code platforms based on the complexity of the manufacturing operation. It outputs recommendations for scalable solutions for the organization.

    Production Analytics & Reporting:
        The generate_production_report() function computes metrics like the total units produced, average production time, and units produced per hour to assess operational performance.

    Security & Compliance:
        The function ensure_security_compliance() ensures the platform complies with industry security standards and regulations (like GDPR, data encryption, secure API integration).

    Executing the Roadmap:
        The execute_digital_transformation_roadmap() function integrates all the steps together: defining the strategy, capturing real-time data, applying AI, generating reports, and ensuring compliance.

Conclusion:

This Python code provides a foundational approach to digitizing the food manufacturing process by integrating AI, IoT, and real-time analytics into the operations. It helps in:

    Identifying the right ERP and no-code platforms.
    Capturing real-time production data and applying AI for predictive quality control.
    Generating production reports for better decision-making.
    Ensuring the system complies with industry security and regulatory standards.

With further development, the system can be extended to fully integrate AI-driven predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization, and advanced analytics for smarter manufacturing.
